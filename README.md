## 📘 Overview

**AutoDimenSys** is a computer vision driven measurement system developed to estimate real-world object dimensions using standard imaging devices such as webcams or smartphone cameras.

The system removes dependency on manual measuring tools and expensive industrial scanners by applying geometric analysis and reference-based calibration techniques. By detecting a known reference object placed near the target item, the system converts pixel distances into accurate physical measurements.

This solution is particularly useful for logistics validation, manufacturing inspection, retail inventory verification, and digital space organization.

## 🎯 Motivation

Manual inspection and measurement processes often introduce inconsistencies due to fatigue and estimation errors. Small industries and MSMEs frequently rely on human inspection for parcel sizing or product validation, which reduces efficiency during repetitive operations.

Although automated dimensioning solutions exist, they typically depend on laser sensors or specialized setups that increase operational cost. This project focuses on creating an affordable alternative capable of operating using commonly available cameras.

## 🔬 Working Methodology

### Image Processing Strategy

Instead of relying on complex learning architectures, the system analyzes geometric and visual properties extracted from captured images.

| Stage | Technique Applied |
|---|---|
| Preprocessing | Grayscale conversion, smoothing |
| Edge Detection | Canny Edge Algorithm |
| Object Detection | Contour extraction |
| Calibration | Reference dimension mapping |

### Measurement Logic

The reference object establishes spatial scale within the image. Once calibrated, object contours are analyzed to determine accurate dimensional boundaries even under rotated placement conditions.

Irregular contour deviations are further analyzed to identify possible dents or deformation.
