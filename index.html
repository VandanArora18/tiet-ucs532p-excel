<h2>1. Research on Existing Similar Work / Competitors</h2>

<div class="section">

<p>
Several technologies and systems already exist that perform object measurement and dimension estimation using imaging and sensing techniques. Studying these systems helps understand current industry practices, technological capabilities, and existing limitations that motivate the need for a low-cost alternative solution.
</p>

<p>
Industrial measurement systems such as Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM) and laser-based 3D scanners are among the most accurate solutions available today. These devices are widely used in manufacturing industries for precision inspection and quality control. They generate highly detailed three-dimensional measurements with sub-millimeter accuracy. However, these systems are extremely expensive, require specialized infrastructure, and must be operated by trained professionals. Due to their cost and operational complexity, they are impractical for small businesses, educational institutions, and everyday users.
</p>

<p>
Another category of similar solutions includes mobile measurement applications based on Augmented Reality (AR). Modern smartphones, especially high-end devices, use depth sensors or LiDAR technology to estimate object dimensions through camera feeds. These applications are convenient and portable, enabling users to measure furniture, rooms, and packages quickly. However, their performance depends heavily on hardware capabilities. Devices without depth sensors experience reduced accuracy, and measurements may become unreliable in cluttered environments or poor lighting conditions.
</p>

<p>
In logistics and warehouse environments, automated parcel dimensioning systems are widely used. These setups employ multiple cameras, infrared beams, and conveyor-mounted sensors to measure package dimensions in real time. They are capable of handling high-volume parcel processing with excellent accuracy and speed. Despite their efficiency, such systems involve significant installation costs, fixed infrastructure, and maintenance requirements, making them unsuitable for small-scale deployment.
</p>

<p>
From the analysis of these existing systems, several limitations are identified. Most solutions require expensive hardware, specialized sensors, or controlled environments. Accessibility is limited, and portability is often compromised. These gaps highlight the need for a cost-effective, camera-based measurement system that can function using standard imaging devices without sacrificing usability.

<h2>2. Research on Possible Techniques for Features (with Justification)</h2>

<div class="section">

<p>
To implement the proposed Automated Object Dimension Measurement System, multiple computer vision techniques were studied and selected based on feasibility, computational efficiency, cost, and measurement accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Object detection within the system is achieved using contour detection and bounding box extraction through OpenCV. Instead of relying on trained deep learning models, the system identifies objects by detecting their edges and outlines. This approach is lightweight, does not require dataset training, and is highly effective in controlled environments where the measurable object is clearly visible.
</p>

<p>
Reference object detection is performed using geometric shape analysis and aspect ratio filtering. Since reference objects such as credit cards or printed markers possess fixed and well-defined shapes, they can be reliably detected through contour approximation and dimensional filtering. This eliminates the need for complex machine learning classification while ensuring dependable scale calibration.
</p>

<p>
Scale calibration is a critical step in the measurement pipeline. The system calculates a pixel-to-metric conversion factor by comparing the detected pixel dimensions of the reference object with its known real-world size. This conversion enables the transformation of image measurements into accurate physical units such as centimeters or millimeters.
</p>

<p>
Perspective distortion, which occurs when images are captured at angles, is handled using homography and perspective transformation techniques. By identifying the corner points of the reference object, the system warps the image into a top-down orthogonal view, thereby improving measurement accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Edge detection and segmentation are implemented using the Canny edge detection algorithm combined with morphological processing. These techniques ensure precise extraction of object boundaries, even in the presence of minor noise or lighting variations.
</p>

<p>
Defect detection is incorporated to assess the structural integrity of the measured object. Using convex hull analysis and solidity computation, the system compares the object’s contour against its ideal geometric shape. Any irregularities such as dents, cuts, or deformations are flagged as defects.
</p>

<p>
Measurement extraction is performed using the Minimum Area Rectangle method, also known as rotated bounding box fitting. This allows the system to measure objects accurately even when they are placed at an angle relative to the camera.
</p>

<p>
In scenarios where object corners are partially hidden, hidden corner estimation is applied. The system detects visible edges using Canny edge detection and extracts linear segments through the Hough Transform. These lines are extended mathematically, and their intersection point is estimated as the missing corner. While this provides an approximation, it is effective for regular geometric objects.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the selected techniques ensure that the system remains computationally efficient, hardware-independent, and cost-effective while delivering reliable measurement performance suitable for industrial, educational, and commercial applications.
